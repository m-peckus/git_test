# Official git documentatiotn on gitignore patterns

  https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format

  Some of most common examples:

  The * character matches any number of characters except for a slash (/). For example, to ignore all .txt files, you could use the following pattern:

  * .txt

  Patterns starting with a / are anchored to the directory containing the .gitignore file. 
  For example, this would ignore a main.py in the root directory, but not in any subdirectories:

  /main.py

  You can negate a pattern by prefixing it with an exclamation mark (!). 
  For example, to ignore all .txt files except for important.txt, you could use the following pattern:
  
  *.txt
  !important.txt

  You can add comments to your .gitignore file by starting a line with a #. For example:
  
  # Ignore all .txt files
  *.txt

  Possible use cases:
  # *.js  //This is comment

  *.txt  // all .txt files ignored, except names.txt
  !names.txt

  /src/main.py   //a file path to a specific file to be ignored

  content.md    // specific file name to ignore
